# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hello! Iâ€™m **Nemanja**, a **certified frontend developer** open to job opportunities and new adventures. I stay up-to-date with the latest frontend technologies and am eager to continue honing my skills. I specialize in **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, with an **advanced understanding of JavaScript(Closures, Asynchronous Programming, OOP)**.
I am also interested in UI/UX design concepts and believe I can be a valuable asset to your team.

All my projects showcase my knowledge and work in **frontend development**. My highlighted projects particularly reflect my **ideas and vision** for web development.
